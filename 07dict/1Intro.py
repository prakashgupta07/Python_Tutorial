# intro to dictionaries
# Q- why we use dictiornaries?
# A- Because of limitations of lists,lists are not enough to represent real data
# example
user=['Prakash',24,['coco','kimi no na wa'],['awakening','fairy tale']]
# this list contaains user name, age,fav movies, fav tunes
# you can do this but this is not good way to do this.
# Q- what are dictionaries?
# A- unordered collections of data in key:value pair
